# wasm4go

A library for making [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/) games with Go (or [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/)).

Unlike the Go bindings that WASM-4 generates by default, this library is idiomatic Go with type safety, no direct memory manipulation and no byte operations. It provides a friendly API that is easy to read and hard to misuse.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/orsinium-labs/wasm4go
```

## Usage

```go
// ...
```

See [examples](_examples) for some real code and [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/orsinium-labs/wasm4go) to learn what's inside.
