# wasm4go examples

This directory contains examples of using [wasm4go](../). Some are small and useless, some are almost real games.

Available examples:

* [hello](./hello/hello.go): the same code example as wasm-4 CLI generates by default.
* [buttons](./buttons/buttons.go): displays on the screen the button you press.
* [snake](./snake/snake.go): re-implementation of the [Snake tutorial](https://wasm4.org/docs/tutorials/snake/goal) from thw official WASM-4 documentation.
* [tests](./tests/tests.go): integration tests for the project.
